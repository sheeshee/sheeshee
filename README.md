Hi, Iâ€™m Sam, a.k.a _sheeshee_. :wave:

I'm interested in scientific computing, data analysis/visualisation, web apps and robotics!
I post all of my coding work here so feel free to take a browse (just be warned, there's a few things I haven't
had a chance to tidy up yet!)

Feel free to reach out and say hi :smile:
